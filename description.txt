A mod that simply removes some of the nerfs Calamity does to the vanilla game.

Main features:
- remove defense damage
- restore NPCs selling potions
- soaring insignia infinity fly again
- no summon damage reduction
- no damage reduction cap
- and more!

Any change in configuration requires reload

NOTE: The tooltips will continue to show the calamity information but the values in the background are the un-nerfed ones, I'm just too lazy to modify each tooltip
